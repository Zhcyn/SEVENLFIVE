General idea: recording focused time period, tracking how much time spent on certian things

Customize tracking lists
-add, remove a list (at most 5 of them)
-name, rename a list (affect display, not data storage)
-reorder lists
  Time fragment
-recorded time period displayed as time fragments in different color
  Sync with iCloud
-use iCloud as remote storage, this will help when user delete and re-install
  Siri integration
-can be control over voice commands
The current project is still under development, and the current stage is mainly to test the integrity of the system and the continuity of the interface.
